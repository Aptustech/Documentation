# Introduction to the {{ module }} module type

The {{ module }} module allows to control Dynamixel motors.

The {{ module }} module type has access to all common capabilities.

----

## Functions

| **function name and parameters** | **action** | **comment** |
| set_id(self, id) | changes motor ID | This new Id will be saved by the Dynamixel motor. You have to detect motors again to make it work after this change. |
| detect(self) | launches a motor detection | You have to run a luos detection to include or exclude new motors. |
| register(self, register, val) | set a Dynamixel register value. | This register only manage *word* size register. Use it only if you know what you do. |
| control(self) | Display module type graphical interface | Only available using Ipython notebook |

## Variables

| **variable name** | **action** | **type** |
| compliant | - True: disable the motor power, you can use it to move the motor by hand.<br/> - False: Enable the motor power. | read / write: Boolean (True or False) |
| target_position | Set the target rotation position to reach in 째. | read / write: Float |
| moving_speed | Set the target rotation speed to reach in 째/s. | read / write: Float |
| wheel_mode | enable or disable wheel mode on motor | read / write: Boolean (True or False) |
| position | Measured position of the motor in 째. | read / write: Float |
| temperature | Measured temperature of the motor in 째C. | read / write: Float |
