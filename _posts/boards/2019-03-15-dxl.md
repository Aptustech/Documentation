## Versions of {{ board }} board

There are two versions of this board. One is the version for XL320 Dynamixel, the other is for other types of Dynamixel (eg. AX12). Both board have a different connector.

Except this connection both versions work exactly the same way.

## How to connect and start the motors to the board

![Dynamixel](/assets/img/dxl-mod-1.jpg)

The Dynamixel board is special because it has a dynamic number of visible modules, depending on the number of motors plugged to it. If you don’t plug any motor in your board, it will create a special module call void_dxl. If you have 5 motors on your board, you will see 5 DynamixelMotor modules.

This board creates modules dynamically upon motor detection. So in order to create module, this board has to detect motors, and to detect them they need to have a proper power supply.

Indeed, if you power the Luos network with a not adapted voltage, the motors won’t reply to the board request and you won’t be able to see any Dynamixel module on your network.

Here is how to properly connect every part together:

1. Connect the {{board}} board to the Luos network and dynamixel motors.
2. Connect the corect power supply to the luos network
3. Eventually connect the USB board to your computer.

Always be sure to respect this order to have a proper startup.

<blockquote class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Dynamixel boards don’t belong to the power category. Thus, do not power your motors on the Robotis side, you won’t be able to share this power with others boards.</blockquote><br />
