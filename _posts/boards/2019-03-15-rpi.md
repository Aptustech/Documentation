## How to setup your {{ board }}'s Wi-Fi

Upon receiving your new Raspberry Pi board along with the actual Raspberry Pi board (already plugged together when you order it), you will need to setup it before to start using it.

First, you have to connect your Raspberry Pi to your Wi-Fi network.

> **Warning:** The Raspberry Pi board is specially designed to work with a Raspberry Pi Zero WH. Plugging any other type of Raspberry Pi board will lead to several power problem.


Several solution exist to configure the Raspberry Pi’s Wi-Fi, we provide you with two of them according to your setup:

### First solution: with a computer and the Raspberry Pi’s SD
You will need the following parts:

 - A micro SD to SD card adapter (provided with your Raspberry Pi board)
 - A computer with Bonjour installed on it
You can download Bonjour by Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999). Install it on your computer if you don’t already have it.

Plug the micro SD card to the micro-SD-to-SD adapter, and plug it to your computer. Ignore the messages that ask you if you want to format, and locate the SD card directory, named Boot. In Windows, it appears as a drive; in MacOS or Linux, go to

```bash
cd /Volumes/boot
```

Create a new file in this directory called wpa_supplicant.conf. The file should contain the following code:

```bash
country=fr
update_config=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

network={
 scan_ssid=1
 ssid="SSID-Internet-box"
 psk="Secured-key"
}
```

Choose the country according to where you live, and replace SSID-Internet-box by the SSID of your internet device, and Secured-key by the password.

Save the file and eject the SD card. Replace it into the Raspberry Pi’s slot.

The Raspberry Pi can be located with the expression raspberrypi.local, thanks to the software Bonjour.

### Second solution: with a screen and a keyboard

![Raspberry-Pi connection](/assets/img/rpi-setup.jpg)

In order to establish a connection, you will need:

<ul>
<li>A QWERTY keyboard</li>
<li>An HDMI screen</li>
<li>An USB charger or USB to micro-USB cable to power up the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>A micro USB to female USB adapter</li>
<li>A micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter</li>
<li>You can find the adapters you need in the Raspberry Pi zero toolkit, for example.</li>
</ul>

Now, plug all these elements on your Raspberry pi (do not plug anything to the Luos board which is already connected to your Raspberry Pi), and power it up. You should see on the screen the boot sequence and the file system expanding. After a few seconds, you should have a prompt asking you for username and password.

Your Raspberry Pi have the default Raspberry username and password:

```
Username: pi
Password: raspberry
```

As you can see at the bottom of the boot screen, the SSH port is now open, so you should start by changing the password of your board to avoid any security issue.

To do that, use the following command:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Choose option 1 to change your password and hostname, and choose option 2 to connect your board to your wifi.

You can check your Wi-Fi connection and retrieve the IP address using

```bash
ifconfig
```

and halt your system using

```bash
sudo halt
```

Your raspberry is now ready to be used, you can start setting your Luos network up.

> **Warning:** Your Raspberry Pi board doesn’t belong to the Power category. Using the power input of your Raspberry Pi doesn’t allow you to supply your others boards. In order to make it work properly, please use a power board on your system.

## How to use your {{ board }}

### Power
Please note that the Raspberry Pi board connected to the Raspberry Pi board is already powered by the Luos network, through the power boards you use (Power board or Battery board).

However, **the USB board can’t power the Raspberry Pi board**, because several voltage transformations are applied along the network. You can also use an universal power supply (+5.1V micro USB) directly plugged to the board.

### Communication mode
By default, your Raspberry Pi starts a Luos service at boot called *pyluos-usb2ws*. This service creates a pipe between a **websocket** opened on **port 9342**, and the Luos system. If you send standard Luos Json data into this web socket, it is directly sent into the Luos network.

This way, you can control your robot from your computer even if it is moving or dispatched. For example, if you are using pyluos to control your robot, you can start your program with:

```python
from pyluos import Robot
robot = Robot("raspberrypi.local")
robot.modules
```

In this example, you can replace raspberrypi.local by your Raspberry Pi’s IP or hostname.

You should see the list of modules connected to the Raspberry Pi board.


### Cognition mode
Also, you can use your Raspberry Pi like an embedded computer for your robot. You are free to use it as you want.

To send your Json data to your network, please use the serial port ‘/dev/ttyAMA0′ of your Raspberry Pi, as you can do it with the USB board.
